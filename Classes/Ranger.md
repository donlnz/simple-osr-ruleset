## General
***HD.*** 1d4.

***Weapon and Armor Restrictions.*** Rangers can use any weapon. If using any armor heavier than leather armor, all Survival skills are performed with disadvantage (roll two dice and choose the worse result).

***Saving Throw Bonus.*** +1 to reflex saving throws and +1 to fortitude saving throws.

## Class Abilities
***Sharpshot.*** Choose a ranged weapon type. You gain +1 to hit and +1 damage when attacking with any weapon of that type.

***Swiftshot.*** At Ranger level 7 and above, gain an additional attack per combat round.

***Survivalist.*** The Ranger is an expert at survival, and applying first aid, hunting, trapping, fishing or foraging for food and water, the Ranger uses their Survival skill. If successful in searching for food, the Ranger gains 1 additional food ration.  In addition, the Survival skill can be used (much like the Scoundrel's Skulduggery skill) for various other survival-related activities, including sneaking, tracking, setting and disarming traps, training animals, or skinning and butchering them.

***Trained Hunter***. The Ranger has a chance, determined by their Survival skill, of recalling insightful information about nature's beasts, including legendary monstrosities. If successful, the Ranger may identify a particular detail about the foe (e.g., particular strengths of weaknesses) that may help them overcome them.

***Skilled Navigator.*** While navigating through the wilderness, a party led by a Ranger has advantage on their rolls when checking for [[Overland Travel and Survival#Travel|getting lost]].
