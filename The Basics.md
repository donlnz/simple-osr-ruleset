Gameplay in the world follows a very basic formula of collaborative storytelling:
1. The Game Master (GM) describes the scene.
2. The Players describe what actions they wish to take.
3. The GM determines and describes the outcome.

Many of the game's rules deal with step 3 above, and describe how to determine uncertain outcomes (commonly through dice rolling). 
## The Turn

When in dangerous environments (e.g. exploring the wilderness or a dungeon), gameplay is formalized through turns. 

1. Determine party's action(s) for the turn.
2. Roll for wandering monsters/random events.
3. Resolve random events and/or party's action(s).
4. Deplete resources as applicable (e.g. light sources, rations, water).

Depending on the circumstances, different rules apply. For the most important rules see:
