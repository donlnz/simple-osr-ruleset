The amount of gear a character can carry is determined by their STR score. Specifically, a character can carry 2 x STR "inventory slots" worth of items. Each item is associated with a weight type (heavy, normal, light, small, tiny or minuscule), and takes up a corresponding amount of inventory slots.
