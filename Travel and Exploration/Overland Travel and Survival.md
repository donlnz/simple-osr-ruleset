 Outdoor travel time is abstracted into **Watches**, with one watch extending for 4 hours. A day is divided into 6 watches, roughly corresponding to:

| Hours | Watch |
|:----:|:-------------|
| 2-6  | Dawn |
| 6-10  | Morning |
| 10-14 | Noon |
| 14-18 | Afternoon |
| 18-22 | Dusk |
| 22-02 | Midnight |

**Watches as Time**. The watch timescale is used to compartmentalize many of the party's actions during the day (and night), with most actions taking time measured in a a single watch (or, several watches). For instance, the party can spend a watch traveling, foraging for food, resting, searching through an area, or, literally, taking watch over the party's camp.

**Random Events**. In addition, watches are used to determine the frequency of random events the party may encounter (wandering bandits, traveling merchants, monster lairs, etc.). Each watch, there is a 1-in-6 chance of encountering a random event (on average, twice per day).

## Outdoor Travel

The world is organized on a hexagonal grid, with each unit-area on the map (_hex_) spanning 2 leagues (10 km) accross—a distance an average unencumbered traveller might be able to traverse in around two hours under ideal conditions. Assuming that adventurers frequently travel off the beaten path (in dense forests, swamps, mountainous regions, etc.) carrying heavy equipment, the default travelling speed is assumed to be slower: a surprisingly convenient **1 hex per watch**. A party looking to avoid overexertion can spend 2 watches (8 hours) traveling per day. Characters can perform a forced march, travelling up to 2 additional hexes in a day, at the risk of accumulating [[Death and Pain#Fatigue]].

**Normal conditions**. Normal conditions assume that a character is rested, uninjured, carrying a light load (i.e. is not encumbered).

**Encumbrance**. A character's movement speed is also halved if they are encumbered (carrying a heavy load).

**Mounted Travel.** Travelling on a steed, e.g. horseback, will generally improve movement speed, especially when travelling on roads or over open terrain such as plains. Encumbrance rules use the strength of the mount rather than the player character.

**Drawn Cart.** Traveling with a drawn cart (using a horse, donkey or mule) does not affect movement speed in normal terrain, but halves movement speed in difficult terrain. Like moving on horseback, encumbrance is calculated based on the strength of the animal pulling the cart.

**Injury**. Certain injuries, such as twisted ankles or broken legs, may affect movement speed negatively.

> ***Example***
> *The Talented Trio*, a small band of adventurers, are traveling towards their next stop: an abandoned hunter's cabin located 8 leagues (40 km) to the northwest (according to the innkeep in Secomber, the small village the party just departed from). The well-rested party members are traveling through the woods towards the hunters cabin on foot, at a pace of 2 leagues per watch, meaning it will take them 4 watches (16 hours) to reach their goal. Having set out from Secomber in the morning, they reach the cabin at midnight, and had a chance of encountering 4 random events during their trip. Once the party has reached the hunter's cabin, they are done traveling for the day. They decide to spend a watch scouting the area before setting up camp in the hunter's cabin at dusk (with a chance of another random encounter). Finally, the party members decide on a watch rotation before settling in, since they want at least one party member to be on the lookout at all times during the night, as there are 2 more chances of random encounters during their 8 hour rest.

## Food and Water
Characters require 1 day's worth of water and food rations per day to sustain themselves, otherwise they risk accumulating [[Death and Pain#Fatigue]].

## Watch Actions
During a watch, characters can take any of the following actions:
* **Travel** to an adjacent hex or to another known area in the current hex.
* **Hunt**, **Trap** or **Fish** for food.
* **Forage** for food or other resources.
* **Explore** the nearby area (current hex).
* **Rest** at a campsite.
* **Stand Watch** over the party's camp.

Note: A party can forage while travelling, halving their travelling speed.

### Travel 
When travelling through unknown regions (i.e., an unexplored hex), there is a 1-in-6 chance of the party getting lost (unless travelling via road or river, or while guided by a clearly visible landmark). Getting lost means the party fail to find their way, and either remain in the current hex, or travel to a neighboring hex other than the intended.

### Hunting, Trapping and Fishing
When spending a watch hunting, trapping or fishing, there is (under normal circumstances, e.g., hunting in a forest) a 1-in-6 chance of obtaining 1d4 food rations. Each character participating in the activity rolls separately.

While trapping, the party must remain at their location, fishing can (naturally) only be done by a body of water, and while hunting, there is a chance to discover the lair of a beast or monster.

### Foraging
While foraging, there is (under normal circumstances, e.g. foraging in a forest) a 1-in-6 chance of obtaining 1d2. Each character participating in the activity rolls separately. In addition, the party has (under normal circumstances) a 2-in-6 chance of finding a water source; this roll is only performed once for the entire party.

Foraging can be performed while travelling at half speed (1 hex per 2 watches). When doing so, a successful foraging attempt yields only 1 food ration. Rolling for finding a water source is performed as usual.

### Exploring
Who know's what you might find? A hidden tomb, a nasty monster's lair, or a mad wizard's tower? Anything is possible!

### Resting
Everyone needs a good night's sleep. Not getting 8 hours (2 watches) of sleep incurs the penalty of [[Death and Pain#Fatigue]].

### Standing Watch
It's never a bad idea to have someone watch over the party's campsite lest the bed bugs bite everyone while they're asleep.
