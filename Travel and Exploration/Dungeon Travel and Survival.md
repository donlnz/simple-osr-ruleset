While exploring dungeons and similar dangerous indoor locales, the time scale is shifted from watches to _turns_, with a single turn spanning 10 minutes of time. Dungeons are usually arranged on a 1.5 x 1.5 meter (5 x 5 feet) square grid.

**Movement Speed**. Normal movement speed through an unexplored dungeon is 36 meters (24 squares) per turn---this might seem slow, but accounts for the fact that the adventurers are assumed to be treading carefully while mapping out the path traveled. Encumbrance and injuries affect movement speed just like with outdoor travel. While traversing previously explored parts of a dungeon, characters move at triple speed.

**While in Combat**. In combat, time is measured by 10 second _combat rounds_. A character is normally able to move 12 meters (8 squares) per combat round.
## Dungeon Dangers

**Random Events**. Much like the outdoors, dungeons often house wandering monsters and other hazards. While exploring a dungeon, random events have a 1-in-6 chance to occur every 3 turns.

**Light**. Dark dungeons require light. Torches burn for 1d4+4 turns and a full oil lantern burns for 1d6+18. Torches and lanterns both cast bright light extending 9 meters (6 squares), and dim light for an additional 6 meters (4 squares). Characters and creatures with **Darkvision** are able to see in complete darkness for a specified distance (typically either 9 or 18 meters).

**Doors**. A character attempting to open a stuck door has a (1 + STR bonus)-in-6 chance to push open a stuck door. They have a (1 + STR bonus)-in-10 chance to force open a locked door. Non-thieves have a 1-in-6 chance of successfully hearing noise (footsteps, voices, etc.) through a door while actively listening. Thieves use their Listen class ability.

**Traps**. Non-thieves have a 1-in-6 chance of detecting hidden traps while actively searching. Thieves use their Remove Traps class ability.

**Secret Doors**. Characters can search 6 meters (4 squares) of wall for secret openings during a single turn. A character has a 1-in-6 chance to detect a secret door (but won't necessarily understand how to open it). Elves and characters with 15 or more INT have a 2-in-6 chance to succeed, and elves with 15 or more INT have a 3-in-6 chance to succeed.
