## Additional Character Attributes

***Hit Points (HP).*** For each level (starting at level 1), roll a hit die of your class' HD type, and add the result plus your CON bonus to your maximum HP. **Example:** A level 1 fighter starts with a maximum HP of 1d8 + CON bonus.

***Armor Class (AC).*** Determines how difficult it is for enemies to hit you with their (physical) attacks. To determine your AC, add 9 (the base AC representing an unarmored character) to your DEX bonus and add any AC bonuses from your armor.

***Hit Chance Bonus.*** Your hit chance bonus (added to any attack roll to affect the odds of your attack finding its target) is determined by your class, your level and your STR or DEX bonus (depending on whether you are attacking with a melee or ranged weapon). To determine your melee weapon hit chance bonus, consult the advacement table for your class, and add your STR bonus; similarly, to detminue your ranged weapon hit chance bonus, consult the same table and add your DEX bonus.

***Melee Damage Bonus.*** When rolling for damage for an attack with a melee weapon, add your STR bonus to the die result.

***Carrying Capacity.*** You have a number of inventory slots equal to twice your STR score (note: not your STR bonus). Light items (e.g., leather armor, daggers and slings) use up one carrying slot; normal size items (e.g., longswords, one-handed maces, light crossbows and ring mail armor) use up two carrying slots; and, heavy items (e.g., two-handed melee swords and axes, longbows and plate mail armor) use up four carrying slots. See [[Items and Equipment]] for more information on item sizes.

***Movement Speed.*** Every player character moves at the same speed: 10 km per 4 hours in the wilderness (under the assumption that the character is carrying a substantial load of equipment) and 5 meters per minute in a dungeon (under the assumption that the character is trying to stay quiet, and is actively looking for traps).

***Saving Throws.*** Determined by class/level and race combination.
