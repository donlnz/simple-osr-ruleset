Characters generally die in one of two ways:
1. They reach -10 HP or less.
2. They accumulate 20 or more levels of fatigue.

## Fatigue
Fatigue is a catch-all system for representing exhaustion, starvation, dehydration and certain effects of disease or injury. Characters gain fatigue e.g. through exherting themselves in a forced march or eating or drinking sufficiently.

* When performing a forced march (moving up to 2 additional hexes in a day), characters must perform a CON ability test for each extra hex traversed. For each failed CON check, a character gains 1 level of fatigue. A character cannot begin a forced march if they already have any levels of fatigue.
* If a character does not eat food in a day, they gain X levels of fatigue, where X is the number of days since they last ate. For example, not eating for one day incurs 1 level of fatigue, whereas not eating for two consecutive days incurs 3 levels of fatigue (1 level of fatigue for the first day, and 2 levels for the second day).
* If a character does not drink water in a day, they gain 2X levels of fatigue, where X is the number of days since they last drank water.

A character with any levels of fatigue:
* Cannot begin a forced march.
* Does not heal HP while resting. Instead, 1 level of fatigue is healed per night's rest.

A character with 5+ levels of fatigue:
* Is considered [[Death and Pain#Encumberance|encumbered]].
* Has [[Ability Tests#Advantage and Disadvantage|disadvantage]] on all WIS and INT ability tests.

A character with 10+ levels of fatigue:
* Is considered unconcious until fully recovered from fatigue.

A character with 20+ levels of fatigue:
* Is dead.

Characters can recover from fatigue by resting (1 level healed per full night's rest), by ingesting certain potions or drugs, or though magical means.

## Health


## Encumberance
If a character is carrying more than their STR score allows (more than 2 x STR up to 4 x STR), they are considered encumbered and will have difficulty moving. In addition, they will perform all attack rolls, DEX ability tests and STR ability tests with [[Ability Tests#Advantage and Disadvantage|disadvantage]]. If a character is carrying more than 4 x STR, they are considered immobile.
